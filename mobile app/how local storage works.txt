Louis Henry's experience with local storage:

There are a lot of databases out there: sql lite, berkleydb, and more
SQL lite is an open source db that lets you store data to a textfile in a device. There is built is sql lite implementation in android itself.

Key concepts with SQL lite

1. Local storage means that it is available when the app is offline

2. Tables and records

3. The four basic operations are insert, update, delete, and search.

4. Filter, Specific, Sort, and Join. When you create a datebase you can create seperate tables, but you have the ability to join differennt tables to make it easier to search.



Database_helper is what is there to create a databse backend. This file should be in the library of class activity 7
