The first task undertaken to create this app was to create the UI. To create the UI a single column with multiple rows was used. This was done to better format and have buttons evenly placed throughout the calculator. Widgets were created for the button and called to. This was done to avoid having to copy and paste the same code multiple times in the file. After the UI was made multiple steps were taken to have the logic and calculator functions work. Once enter was pressed the entire list would be worked on in the calculations function. It has if else cases that mirror pemdas and will replace three items with one untill there are no operations left, this is done recursivelly. The result will be sent to the display variable and visible to the user. Nulling the buttons was used so the user would not break the calculator. For example, a math operation cannot start with a division sign, so that sign and many others are nullified. All keys except the cancel will be nullified when enter is pressed to ensure the user clears the list to begin their next calculation. Since decimals were not part of the requirements, all numbers are rounded and the user is informed that in the top of the app.
