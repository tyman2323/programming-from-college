Although BASH, C#, and C are programming languages, they are very different. For one, BASH is an interprative language as opposed to a compiled on like C and C#. This means that BASH will be slower than C and C# in projects that are larger at scale, but for small scale programs it should be fine as a scripting tool. C is faster and smaller than C# because it is closer to hardware. With the trade off of being lower level, it is harder to use and takes more time for the programmer to finish their program. This means that using either of the two is conditional on what the programmer wants to accomplish. For example, C# would be great for creating a video game, while C would be best for creating the operating system for smart glasses. BASH would best be used for running a script that scrapes through multiple output files of a network to find server outages. Each of these languages serve a seperate role. Rather than comparing and being stuck on one saying "This is the best language" use the language as a  tool for a specific problem, rather than using screw driver to hammer a nail.
